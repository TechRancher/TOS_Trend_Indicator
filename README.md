## :gear: About ##

**Disclaimer**  _In order to demonstrate the functionality of my script, I used actual ticker symbols in the chart images. However, I do not make recommendations or determine the suitability of any security or strategy for individual traders. Any investment decision you make in your self-directed account is solely your responsibility. Be sure to backtest any strategy to determine if you understand the risks involved with each strategy._  

This will detect the trend of your chart based on the time of your chart and the time you set the Trend_Indicator to detect. Example: 1D 1M chart with trend length time frame at 5 would give you the trend for the past 5 bars. This will be displayed in the top left of your chart as either Uptrend or Downtrend.
